We talked about dependencies on Bluemartini and took an approach of following Data flow and look at the work affected.
The recomended project dependencies would be following. Below are also listed the data dependencies -


Project Dependencies:
=====================
Some of these work streams can be in parallel, or change order depending what projects get worked sooner than later.

####Work Stream - website

1. Payment Authorization
2. Contact Center
3. Checkout
    Build RESTful Checkout outside of BM using RESTful APIs (getAddress, getPayment, getUser, getInventory, 
    getPrice, makePayment etc).
4. User Account


####Work Stream - Merchandising platform
1. Assorting
2. Publishing content
3. Prices
4. Virtual Assortments

Note 
  - Assorting products will only affect Product Array, which could move out of BM with the new search architecture.
  - Processes will need to be looked at depending on where the data will reside in the future state.




Data Dependencies:
==================
- Product related info from PIM  -> BM
- Inventory from OMS into a cache OMS -> BM
- Price data from Price System / AMS   -> BM
- Order, authorization and account data from BM Generated within BM


Action Items:
=============
- Talk to Ryan Martin about common payment service for all banner websites - Jayanth
- Contact Center Representatives for functionality gap between OMS COM and ideal state. Group wanted to table this untill we solidify
