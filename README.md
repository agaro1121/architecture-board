HBC Architecture Board
==================

The boardâ€™s objective is to facilitate a broader conversation with the engineers at HBC who are making daily decisions on the technology they are using within their teams. We also hope to make the overall discussion of architecture more inclusive and more transparent.


Architecture Councils
---------------------

We believe that a good way to accomplish the goals of the board is to facilitate periodic in person meetings, which we are calling Architecture Councils. All engineers are invited to these councils. Councils are streamed so that off-site engineers can participate.

We expect to convene these meetings every three to five months.

Example of agenda items for the architecture councils:
    - Review key RFCs
    - Design reviews for systems we admire
    - Presentations by teams that have worked on something interesting for the wider tech organization.
    - Discussion of a proposal on standards that the architecture board is preparing
    - Workshops for architecture topics of general interest.


General Structure
-----------------

  - The architecture board consists of two members from each product team, data team and infrastructure team, as well as the architect.
  - The teams can decide themselves who should represent them on the architecture board.
  - Teams should re-evaluate their representatives once per year.
  - One member of the board will serve as Chair. The chair is elected by the board members to a one-year term.
  - Each team should have at least one representative present at board meetings.
  - All board members continue to serve as first class team members as their primary role.
  - Tech exec and team management will encourage teams to actively plan time for architecture into all ongoing work.
  - The SVP Engineering, SVP Packaged Software and VP Infrastructure act as BDFLs on the board.



High-level responsibility
-------------------------

  - The architecture board will provide comments into company wide review process on duties related to Software Architecture.
  - Chair responsibilities:
    - Convene weekly board meetings.
    - Share agenda + minutes with all of tech from each board meeting - most important here is to make transparent all of the decisions, non decisions, and discussions
    - Convene Architecture Councils
  - Primary responsibilities:
    - Make it easier to brainstorm solutions to problems and to share results
    - Highlight best practices across all our teams
    - Minimize duplication of effort across HBC.
    - Define standards for inter team communication.
    - Assist teams in solving hard technical problems in simple, scalable ways.
    - Assist teams in resolving disagreements about technical decisions.
    - Assess specific technologies - both already at HBC or not yet in use at HBC
    - Maintain an HBC Tech Radar
  - Allocate portion of time if other engineers need their help
  - Publish and maintain a simple means to contact the board for help with issues and visibility of the feedback loop through to resolution
  - Establish an annual review to ensure all standards are actively reviewed.

Board Meetings
--------------

  - The main goal of the meetings is to share information as well as discuss and decide on architectural topics that affect the entire tech organization.
  - The meeting agenda will be distributed by the Chair in advance of every meeting.
  - All members can raise topics to be discussed at board meetings.
  - Each meeting has a scribe to keep track of the minutes.
  - Meeting minutes are shared with all of tech after each meeting.

Decision making process
-----------------------

  - Discussions about important decisions are announced one week in advance to the architecture board members to give everyone enough time to prepare and a chance to attend the meeting.
  - All members present at the board meeting when the decision is made, can vote.
  - Decisions are made via majority vote.
  - In case of a stalemate, the chair has the deciding vote.
  - The BDFLs have passive membership on the architecture board with no voting rights, but have the right to veto decisions (by majority vote amongst the BDFLs). In case of a stale mate amongst the BDFLs the veto is decided via a cage fight.
